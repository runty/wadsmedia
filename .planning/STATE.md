# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-13)

**Core value:** Users can manage their media libraries through natural conversation -- text a message, get things done, no UI to learn.
**Current focus:** Phase 1: Foundation

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 8 phases derived from 34 requirements -- Foundation, Messaging, Users, Media Clients, LLM, Search, Library, Status
- [Roadmap]: Phases 4 and 5 can run in parallel (media clients and conversation engine are independent)
- [Roadmap]: Phase 5 (Conversation Engine) flagged for potential deeper research on prompt engineering and tool schema design
- [01-01]: Biome v2.3 config schema differs from v1.x docs -- uses assist.actions.source.organizeImports and files.includes with !! double-exclude
- [01-01]: Excluded .claude/ and .planning/ from Biome to avoid linting GSD tooling files
- [01-01]: Fastify bundles its own Pino -- do not install Pino as direct dependency

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 5: LLM provider compatibility (strict function calling mode) needs verification across OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama during implementation
- Phase 4: Sonarr/Radarr API version (v3 vs v4) needs live verification during implementation
