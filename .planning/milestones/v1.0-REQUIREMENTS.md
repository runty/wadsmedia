# Requirements: WadsMedia

**Defined:** 2026-02-13
**Core Value:** Users can manage their media libraries through natural conversation -- text a message, get things done, no UI to learn.

## v1 Requirements

Requirements for initial release. Each maps to roadmap phases.

### Search & Discovery

- [ ] **SRCH-01**: User can search for movies by title via natural language
- [ ] **SRCH-02**: User can search for TV shows by title via natural language
- [ ] **SRCH-03**: User can see if media is already in library when searching
- [ ] **SRCH-04**: App auto-picks best match when confident, asks user to choose when ambiguous
- [ ] **SRCH-05**: User can ask for upcoming air dates for shows and movies

### Library Management

- [ ] **LIB-01**: User can add a movie to wanted list with sensible defaults
- [ ] **LIB-02**: User can add a TV show to wanted list with sensible defaults
- [ ] **LIB-03**: User can remove/unmonitor media via natural language
- [ ] **LIB-04**: User can reference previous conversation context ("add that one too", "actually the second one")

### Status & Monitoring

- [ ] **STAT-01**: User can check download progress and queue status
- [ ] **STAT-02**: User can view upcoming episode/movie schedule
- [ ] **STAT-03**: App proactively notifies users when downloads complete or new episodes are available

### Conversation & LLM

- [ ] **CONV-01**: App interprets natural language via configurable OpenAI-compatible LLM
- [ ] **CONV-02**: Full conversation history persisted per user with sliding context window for LLM calls
- [ ] **CONV-03**: LLM uses tool/function calling for structured Sonarr/Radarr actions
- [ ] **CONV-04**: Confirmation required before destructive actions (remove/delete)

### User Management

- [x] **USER-01**: Admin user designated via environment variable
- [x] **USER-02**: Known users identified by phone number whitelist
- [x] **USER-03**: Unknown numbers prompted for their name, then admin texted for approval
- [x] **USER-04**: Each user has a display name stored with their profile
- [x] **USER-05**: Per-user conversation isolation (users only see their own history)

### Messaging

- [x] **MSG-01**: Modular messaging provider interface with Twilio RCS/SMS as initial implementation
- [x] **MSG-02**: Incoming messages received via webhook with signature validation
- [x] **MSG-03**: Outgoing messages sent via provider API
- [x] **MSG-04**: Responses designed text-first (readable as plain SMS with RCS enhancement)

### Media Server Integration

- [ ] **API-01**: Sonarr API client with typed HTTP wrapper and Zod validation
- [ ] **API-02**: Radarr API client with typed HTTP wrapper and Zod validation
- [ ] **API-03**: Quality profiles and root folders fetched dynamically on startup
- [ ] **API-04**: Graceful handling when Sonarr or Radarr is unreachable

### Infrastructure

- [x] **INFRA-01**: Single Docker container deployment via Dockerfile + docker-compose.yml
- [x] **INFRA-02**: All configuration via environment variables
- [x] **INFRA-03**: SQLite database with Docker volume persistence
- [x] **INFRA-04**: Structured logging (JSON) via Pino
- [x] **INFRA-05**: Health check endpoint

## v2 Requirements

Deferred to future release. Tracked but not in current roadmap.

### Additional Media Services

- **MEDIA-01**: Lidarr integration for music management
- **MEDIA-02**: Readarr integration for book management

### Additional Messaging Providers

- **MSGV2-01**: Telegram messaging provider
- **MSGV2-02**: Discord messaging provider
- **MSGV2-03**: Signal messaging provider

### Intelligence

- **INTEL-01**: Contextual suggestions ("People who like X also watch Y")
- **INTEL-02**: Usage analytics (what do users ask for most, what fails)
- **INTEL-03**: RCS rich cards/carousels for search results on supported devices

### Advanced Library

- **ADVL-01**: Season-level granularity (request specific seasons only)
- **ADVL-02**: Multiple Sonarr/Radarr instance support (4K + 1080p)

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Web dashboard / admin UI | Contradicts messaging-first value. Overseerr does this better. |
| Approval workflow / request system | Over-engineering for personal/household servers. Whitelist IS the approval. |
| Media playback control | Different domain (Plex/Jellyfin/Kodi APIs). Massive scope expansion. |
| Voice interface | Requires speech-to-text, different UX concerns. Text messaging is the sweet spot. |
| Self-serve user registration | Security risk. Admin controls access via conversational onboarding. |
| Per-user request quotas | Over-engineering. Whitelisted users are trusted. Remove if abuse occurs. |
| Direct torrent/usenet management | Sonarr/Radarr abstract this. Exposing internals creates fragile interface. |
| Rich media previews (posters) | SMS has limited support. Text descriptions sufficient. Include links for browsers. |
